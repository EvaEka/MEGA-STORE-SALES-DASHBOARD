👁️ Project Overview 
-
In this analysis, I explored the datset to understand the various ways in which the store had incurred some profits and losses. The data set was thoroughly examined by noting the differences in sales from the best perfoming city, the sales trend over a certain period, region, shipping time, the customers, the top states and lastly the sub categories. The objective was to uncover patterns, pinpoint opportunities for improvement, and provide data-driven recommendations to enhance profitability and operational efficiency.

The products sold sold range from tables, machines, chairs, bookcases, copiers and lots more. Being able to grasp the sales and performance trend only allows the business visualize it's loopholes and where to fill up.
