👁️ Project Overview 
-
In this analysis, I explored the dataset to understand the various ways the store had incurred some profits and losses. The data set was thoroughly examined by noting the differences in sales from the best-performing city, the sales trend over a certain period, region, shipping time, the customers, the top states, and lastly, the subcategories. The objective was to uncover patterns, pinpoint opportunities for improvement, and provide data-driven recommendations to enhance profitability and operational efficiency.

📖 Introduction
-
The MegaStore is a supermarket that sells home appliances and stationery. It has a list of distributors across different regions ( Central, South, West, and East ), and its business is spread across several cities. The products sold range from tables, machines, chairs, bookcases, copiers, and lots more. Being able to grasp the sales and performance trend only allows the business to visualize its loopholes and where to fill them.

🎯 Project Targets
-
This analysis aimed to answer the following questions;

➡️ Which city performed best?

➡️ How many sales were made?

➡️ Which month had the most sales?

➡️ What product category had the most orders?

🔍 Observations
-
💳 Sales Trend
-

Sales had reduced at the beginning of the year in February, and by December, they had seen a significant change, possibly because the product was in high demand at the time. 

👤 SalesPerson
-

Anne Pryor performed the best for the year by contributing through purchases made.

📦 Product
-

The Product Category was divided into two: The product category and the sub-category. In both categories, the most performing products were bookcases and binders in the stationery department. 

🌎 Region
-
The Central Region had the best performance in product purchase and shipping. 

Recommendations
-
- Customer Appreciation and Reward: Customers who perform well are to be appreciated either with coupons or a public display. This can be decided by the customer relations team.

- Product Line Extension: The Business Development team can liaise with sales to find the top low-performing products and replace them with popular options that are budget-friendly.

- Regional expansion and strategic placement: The regional performance was good but it can be better by structuring and regulating the products that are being sold.

Conclusion
-
Every business deserves to thrive, but only through services that sort after. In other words, fine-tuning the services a company offers and letting them know where to focus is what analytics does. In the recommendations above, the company can leverage the various recommendations given.
